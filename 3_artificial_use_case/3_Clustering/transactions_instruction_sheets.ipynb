    "1. **Step 1: Data loading & preprocessing**\n",
    "    - load the data into Python Notebook and convert it to the appropriate format (dataframe, numpy.array, list, etc.)\n",
    "    - observe & explore the dataset\n",
    "    - check for null values\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Step 2: Data modelling**\n",
    "    - standardize the data to normal distribution \n",
    "    - pick one data modelling approach respectively the Python modelling package that you would like to use\n",
    "    - fit the training dataset to the model and train the model\n",
    "    - output the model \n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Step 3: Result extration & interpretation**\n",
    "    - make your conclusions and interpretation on the model and final results\n",
