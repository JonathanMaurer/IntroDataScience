    "There are only two options on how I think you will perceive this lecture. If you have some IT background and already some experience with OOP, this notebook will be a piece of cake. If these notebooks are your first programming experience, you may feel a bit confused at the beginning. Don't worry, once you get a grip of it, the path of OOP in Python will be smooth! The truth is, we have all been there when we first met OOP. \n",
    "\n",
    "## What is OOP?\n",
    "Imagine that you have a store with clothes. You are an IT person which is in charge of software that is supporting this store. The software holds information on all the products that are being offered - prices, sizes, counts, colours, anything. As we are talking about clothes - new pieces of clothing are coming every month. During the first months, you are describing with data structures manually every piece of clothing - what its parameters are, what functions are available in the online shop with regards to this item.\n",
    "\n",
    "After a few months, you get bored by how repetitive your work is! You realize that many items belong into a certain **group**. For example, many items can be simply regarded as *shirts*. Now, each shirt is going to have some **characterists** and certain **actions** can be done with it. For example, it has collar, it covers upper part of body. We are able to filter by the general size, size at waist and also length within our online shop. Each particular shirt is an **object**. The *shirt group* is a  **class** into which all particular objects (shirts) belong. This class is going to have some **methods** which relate to the characteristics of the shirts and what can be done with those. Each particular shirt which is in the store will now **inherit** some properties of the class, which will simplify the job for us.\n",
    "\n",
    "The creation of classes, with respective methods and inheritance for objects will save us a lot of time! **Whenever a new shirt arrives, we just attribute it into shirts class and so it will instantly inherit all the methods.**\n",
