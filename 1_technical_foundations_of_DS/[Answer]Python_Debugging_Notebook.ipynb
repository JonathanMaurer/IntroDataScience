    "This Jupyter notebook contains 10 tasks and is meant to be a checkpoint for your Python skill (on a very basic level). \n",
    "Each task is worth 1 point. You must achieve at least 7 points in order to pass this checkpoint. \n",
    "You may find helpful inserting a markdown cell if you feel like explaining your code or your thought process. \n",
    "\n",
    "The notebook is inside of a folder called 05_Assessment. Inside the folder there are three files:\n",
    "- Python_Debugging_Notebook.ipynb, which is the file you are currently looking at\n",
    "- TestExample.png file that contains an useful example on how the feedback from the tests should be interpreted\n",
    "- 2015.csv, where data for some of the exrcises is contained \n",
    "- tests.ipynb, which contains tests for checking your code - you can run these tests using the **last code cell at the bottom of this notebook**, you have to pass at least 7/10 tests\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2.Your Task\n",
    "- Fill out the **TODOs** tasks in each section of the Jupyter notebook. \n",
    "- Run all the cells and test your code at the bottom of this notebook - you should pass at least 7/10 tests\n",
    "- Finally after you pass the tests, go back to the \"Your turn with Git\" section and push your branch as described there. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Although most of the tasks should be easily solveable (considering you went through the previous notebooks) note that this is a **debugging notebook** and it is meant to make you solve and understand any errors you are getting (Google is your best friend). \n",
