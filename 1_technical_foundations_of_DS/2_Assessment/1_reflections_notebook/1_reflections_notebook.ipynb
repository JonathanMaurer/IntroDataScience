When we are learning something new, it might be helpful to keep a *learning diary* to which we are writing our own reflections of what are learning. One of the ways how this is helpful is that the material 'passes through' additional channel - our hands when we are writing it or typing it. This way a much larger portion of studied material can be remembered.  \n",
